## For Loop
    A For loop in Bash allows you to execute a set of commands repeatedly.
    It is highly flexible and can work with numbers, words, arrays, command line variables, or the output of other commands.

    A while loop in Bash is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. 
    This is useful for automating repetitive tasks.

# Command-Line Arguments
    In Unix shell scripting, command-line arguments allow you to pass data to a script at runtime, making it more dynamic and reusable. 
    These arguments are accessed inside the script using special variables.
