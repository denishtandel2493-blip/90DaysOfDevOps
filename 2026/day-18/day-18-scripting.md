## Basic Functions
    Shell script functions are a powerful tool used to group reusable code blocks, making scripts more modular, readable, and maintainable. 
    Functions in shell scripting help break down complex procedures into simpler subroutines, which can be reused throughout the script.

## Functions with Return Values
        Returns values are the values that a bash function returns through the exit status when the function is completed.

## Strict Mode — set -euo pipefail
        Strict mode helps catch errors early and makes scripts more reliable by enabling
        -    set -e → Exit immediately if a command fails.
        -    set -u → Treat unset variables as an error.
        -    set -o pipefail → Fail if any command in a pipeline fails.
##  Local Variables
        local variable:- Declares a variable that exists only inside the function where it’s defined.
        Outside the function not work
